## Project Overview
The **Automated Resume Ranking System** is an AI-powered application designed to evaluate and rank resumes based on their relevance to job descriptions. Using advanced NLP techniques and machine learning models, this system automates the hiring process while incorporating AIOps, MLOps, and LLMops frameworks for enhanced scalability, reliability, and maintainability.

## Features
- **NLP Techniques**: Implements Named Entity Recognition (NER), text classification, and semantic similarity to extract relevant information.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Utilizes models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting for effective resume ranking.
- **AIOps Integration**: Monitors system performance and detects anomalies.
- **MLOps Pipelines**: Automates model development, training, and deployment processes.
- **LLMops Application**: Enhances semantic understanding and provides personalized feedback to job seekers.

## System Architecture
The architecture comprises the following components:

1. **Resume and JD Upload**: Interface for uploading resumes and job descriptions.
2. **NLP Preprocessing**: Extracts relevant features from the input texts.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Converts text into numerical representations (TF-IDF, embeddings).
4. **ML Model**: Ranks resumes using machine learning models.
5. **AIOps Monitoring**: Monitors system performance and optimizes operations.
6. **Feedback Mechanism**: Collects user feedback to improve the system.

## Usage
To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Start the server:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
2. Access the application:
    - Open your web browser and go to [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)

## Evaluation
The system can be evaluated based on these metrics:

- **Accuracy**: Measures how accurately resumes are ranked.
- **Scalability**: Assesses the system's ability to handle large volumes of data.
- **Explainability**: Provides insights into the model's ranking decisions using SHAP techniques.

## Conclusion
The **Automated Resume Ranking System** utilizes state-of-the-art AI technologies to streamline the hiring process, benefiting both employers and job seekers.
